	<h1>Some of my Videos</h1>

			<!-- Hey Sarah - I saw that the HTML validator didn't like the iframe links I included from youtube so I'm looking forward to learning more about CSS to fix that today! -->


	<p>Here's a quick selection of some of my youtube videos.  I'm a bit of a dork but whatever.....</p>

	<h2>Brix of Funk by Sylva</h2>

	<p>This is a song by my band Sylva.  We're about to release this music on the public, so this is top secret for now!  Don't tell the guys I shared this with you ;-)</p>

	<h2>The Haunted Touareg</h2>

	<p>For the technically inclided, this one is kinda fun.  Had a VW Touareg that developed a strange issue where the A/C unit failed, but all the fans would turn on full blast when I opened the center console glove compartment.  Even if the car was turned off.  Ask me later how I figured that one out.</p>

	<h2>Pug vs. Pug</h2>

	<p>And finally, since I'm more of a dog person than a cat one, why not include a fun video featuring the coolest dogs on the planet, pugs!  This one included my dearly departed best friend, Zoe, as she reigns victorious over Hemi and Shelby. </p>
