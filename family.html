		<!-- Hey Sarah - I used a percent value to quickly resize my images and it worked, but the HTML validator isn't happy about that.  So I'd like to know more about why that's not ok.  Thanks! -->

		<p>I lot of what I do these days has to do with these two little cuties.  Miles is an afficiando of Minecraft.  In his spare time (e.g. when his iPad battery dies) he likes to battle whomever isn't paying attention in a solid game of Nerf Gun Wars!</p>

		<p>Phoebe is a rascal.  Don't let this cute face fool you.  I'm so in trouble once she becomes a teenager!  Recently on the way to school we had an emergency need for an outfit change.  After a quick pit-stop at Target, a new outfit was acquired and this picture was taken.  My favorite comment from this was when, after picking out the clothes she said "now I can look like daddy!"</p>

		<p>Teresa is my best friend.  We're both musicians (she's a killer singer/songwriter that you can learn more about via <a href="http://www.teresastorch.com">www.teresastorch.com</a>) and we're both dorks.  Aside from being a killer .NET developer as well, she also has recently become quite fond of Pokemon!  Here she is with a Pikachu she just got for Phoebe....or at least that's what she tells me ;-)</p>
