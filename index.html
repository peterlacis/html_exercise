		<p>Hi!  I'm Peter and I'm a lover of all things geek.  I love to build things and fix things.  I'm also a musician (specifically a guitarist) and love to play live music.  When I'm not doing those things, I'm doing all things dad for my two kiddos, Miles and Phoebe.</p>

		<p>This is Argo</p>

		<p>I'm not sure where I found him, but I like his style.</p>

		<p>I've worked in enterprise IT for most of my career.  I came to CodeCraft because I needed to satiate the need to learn how to finally do this stuff myself.  I've been a "hack" at all things web for years so I figured it was high time to learn how to do things properly.  I'm very psyched to be here!</p>

		<p>I've written a few other pages here that I'd like to share including one about my <a href="family.html">family</a> and some <a href="video.html">youtube videos</a>that I wanted to share.</p>
